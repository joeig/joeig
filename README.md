Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Johannes, a freelance DevOps Engineer who likes to build
reliable applications for the cloud.

While I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, my preferred
tech stack consists of:

  * Golang
  * TypeScript
  * Kubernetes
  * Terraform
  * Amazon Web Services

If you have interesting projects, then it's time to get in
touch.
